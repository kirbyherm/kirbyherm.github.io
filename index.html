<br>
	I am a Nuclear Astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University
        supported by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics -- Center for the Evolution of the Elements. My expected graduation is Spring 2023 and I am interested in both industry and academic opportunities.
<br>
<br>    
        My research interests include Urca cooling in superbursting systems, 
        nucleosynthesis in core-collape supernovae, and optimizing accelerator 
        methods for nuclear astrophysics experiments.
<br>
<br>  
A list of my scientific publications can be found <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EkZJ2RUAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>, and a brief description of my projects are available on my <a href="https://kirbyherm.github.io/research">research page</a>. For more information, 
	please see my <a href="/assets/docs/hermansen_resume.pdf">resume</a>, and my advisor's <a href="https://nucastro.weebly.com/">group page</a>.
<br>

<br>
        Additionally, I am very interested in energy and climate policy, and ensuring responsible stewardship of nuclear weapons and waste.
