	I am a Nuclear Astrophysics Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University
        supported by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics -- Center for the Evolution of the Elements. 
        My expected graduation is Fall 2023 and I am interested in both industry and academic opportunities. 
        I love collecting, cleaning, and modeling data and enjoy finding ways to put that skill set to good use.
<br>
<br>    
        My research interests include Urca cooling in superbursting systems, 
        nucleosynthesis in core-collape supernovae, and optimizing accelerator 
        methods for nuclear astrophysics experiments.
