	I am a Senior Associate Quantitative Analyst, Economic Services at KPMG, based in the Detroit, MI office. I graduated with my PhD in Nuclear Astrophysics from Michigan State University in December 2023.
        I love collecting, cleaning, and modeling data and enjoy finding ways to put that skill set to good use.
<br>
<br>    
        Previously, my research interests included Urca cooling in superbursting systems, 
        nucleosynthesis in core-collape supernovae, and optimizing accelerator 
        methods for nuclear astrophysics experiments.
