<i>Video showing the evolution of a sample optimization of two parameters on the SECAR recoil separator </i>
<br>
<br>
In an upcoming paper, we sought to find a method to optimize the magnet settings of the SECAR recoil separator in order to produce the best separation between the recoil beam and the unreacted beam, while minimizing the beam size throughout the separator. The above video shows a sample of how the optimizer will seek magnet settings which improve (in this case, lower is better) the focal plane resolutions. See the <a href="http://secar.space/">SECAR Collaboration website</a> for more information.

<br>
In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abafb5"> Hermansen et al. (2020)</a>, we looked at the most important reaction rates involved in the production of gamma-ray emitting isotopesin core-collapse supernovae.
