<!--I work primarily on computational nuclear astrophysics. My research interests include <b>compact objects</b>, astrophysical sources of <b>gravitational waves</b>, and <b>core-collape supernovae</b>. Below I will talk about some of my past and future efforts in these different interests.

In an upcoming paper, we sought to find a method to optimize the magnet settings of the SECAR recoil separator in order to produce the best separation between the recoil beam and the unreacted beam, while minimizing the beam size throughout the separator.

In <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abafb5"> Hermansen et al. (2020)</a>, we looked at the most important reaction rates involved in the production of gamma-ray emitting isotopesin core-collapse supernovae.
