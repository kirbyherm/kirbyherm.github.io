<h1 class="page-heading"><b><u>2025-08-28</u></b></h1>

I sat on the side of the road, in a squat-sit on a half curb that had been weathered away. My stomach was rolling. I had glided down the hill two blocks away until I reached max acceleration and thought that my legs could pump me up to the crest of the hill I sat on now without slowing. 

It was a sadly small hill. Steep yes, but nothing that should prove this challenging. I sat there now with my stomach at the peak of anxiety. I laid back, tried to ease my body in the shade of the trees lining the street. It was such a nice day and I only sat here now because my body gave out. 

I rolled onto one side, stomach no easier. I dry-heaved, hacking toward the half-dead grass below my cheek. A car passed by. "Surely my bike hid me from the view of the car", I prayed. 

I lay leaning toward the grass, my backpack sliding further off my back and leaving my position even more awkward as the truck slowly backed up. 

"Hey are you ok?" A woman yelled at me from the driver's side of the truck. She seemed very kind and genuinely concerned. The man next to her had the look of a construction worker, like those who were constantly moving up and down our street of late. 

"Yeah I'm ok, just having a bit of a rough one" I lied back, embarrassment quickly overtaking the knot in my stomach for the prevailing concern on my mind. 

The kindly woman asked another question that my brain could not process and I simply replied with "No I'm ok, thank you for checking on me, I do appreciate it" as I tried to lay back down and return to find some way of alleviating the concern that left me here in such a state of embarrassment.

The truck had barely pulled away before I rolled over and expelled much of my anxiety directly onto the grass. The smell of cheap chocolate sauce filled my head. Plastic, store-brand generic, I could picture the cheap bottle and plastic top like that of a condiment tray. Hot dogs at the ballpark. A mix of bloat and manufactured plastic. 

A second heaving snapped me away from the thoughts of plastic and industry and modernity only for the smell to wash over me, gagging and heaving once more.

I fall back again on my side, stomach emptied of the most contemptible of the offending agents. The adrenaline and anxiety begin to abate from the fore of my brain, as another bike ride pulls up into the driveway I am sitting next to.

"Are you ok?" he asks. 

"Yeah. Just came up that hill and my stomach rioted."

"That hill over there? Yeah that's a steep one. Sure you're good?"

"Yeah thanks" I say as I slowly pick myself, my backpack and my discarded helmet and riding gloves up and begin to walk my bike down the street, head and thoughts coming back into focus.
